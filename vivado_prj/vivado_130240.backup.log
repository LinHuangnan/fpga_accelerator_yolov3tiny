Some Ultra RAMs may be reimplemented as non Ultra RAM primitives later in the synthesis flow. Multiple instantiated Ultra RAMs are reported only once. Fields "FF provided for Pipeline" and "FF absorbed" respectively indicate number of registers available for pipelining and number of registers absorbed in the URAM matrix for pipelining.

Some Ultra RAMs may be reimplemented as non Ultra RAM primitives later in the synthesis flow. Multiple instantiated Ultra RAMs are reported only once. Fields "FF provided for Pipeline" and "FF absorbed" respectively indicate number of registers available for pipelining and number of registers absorbed in the URAM matrix for pipelining.

Note: The table above is a preliminary report that shows the Ultra RAMs at the current stage of the synthesis flow. Some Ultra RAMs may be reimplemented as non Ultra RAM primitives later in the synthesis flow. Multiple instantiated Ultra RAMs are reported only once. Fields "FF provided for Pipeline" and "FF absorbed" respectively indicate number of registers available for pipelining and number of registers absorbed in the URAM matrix for pipelining.
